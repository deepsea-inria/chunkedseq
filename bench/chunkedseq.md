Synopsis
========

chunkedseq.byte [*ACTION*] [*PARAMETERS*]...

Description
===========

chunkedseq.byte is a script whose purpose is to benchmark the implementation
of our chunked-sequence data structure. The script automates all aspects of
the benchmarking: building binaries, generation of input data, running
of experiments, and output of experimental data, including plots, tables,
and raw data.

Options
=======

Actions
-------

The action selects the overall behavior of the script.
*ACTION* can be one of the following:

`configure`
:   Generate configuration files that are required by PASL.

`generate`
:   Generate graph files that are to be used by the graph-traversal
    experiments.

`fifo`
:   Run the "fifo" benchmark.

`lifo`
:   Run the "lifo" benchmark.

`split_merge`
:   Run the "split-merge" benchmark.

`bfs`
:   Run the serial BFS benchmark.

`dfs`
:   Run the serial DFS benchmark.

`pbfs`
:   Run the parallel BFS benchmark.

`filter`
:   Run the parallel filter benchmark.

`map`
:   Run the dynamic-dictionary benchmark.

`report`
:   Generate a table reporting on execution times of benchmarks runs.

`all`
:   Build binaries, generate graphs, and then run all benchmarks.

Parameters
----------

Parameters select finer details of the behavior of the script.
*PARAMETERS* can be zero or more of the following:

`-runs` *n*
:   Specifies the number of times *n* to execute for each combination of 
    benchmark parameters. Default is 1.

`-timeout` *n*
:   Force a specific timeout for runs. The timeout value *n* is measured
    in seconds.

`-mode` *m*
:   Where *m* is `normal` (discard all previous results) or `append`.
    (append to previous results) or `replace` (discard results that are ran again)
    or `complete` (add results that are missing).

`--virtual_run`
:   Only show the list of commands that would be called to run the benchmarks.

`--virtual_generate`
:   Only show the list of commands that would be called to generate the graphs
    used by the graph-search experiments.

`-skip` *a1*,*a2*,...
:   Skip selected actions. Note: `-skip run` automatically activates
    `-skip make`.

`-only` *a1*,*a2*,...
:   Perform only selected actions.

`-path_to_graph_data` *PATH*
:   Force a specific path in which to store graph data. Default is `_data`.

`-path_to_pasl` *PATH*
:   Force a specific path to the root of the PASL source tree. Default is `.`.

Compilation parameters
----------------------

`-allocator` *a*
:   Select a drop-in replacement for malloc/free by specifiying a custom 
    library *a*.

`--use_hwloc`
:   Compile PASL binaries with support for hwloc.

`-path_to_`*PACKAGE* *PATH*
:   Configure PASL to look for package named *PACKAGE* in the 
    path *PATH*.

Sample applications
===================

- Configure all PASL binaries to use hwloc.

        ./chunkedseq.byte configure --use_hwloc -path_to_hwloc /pathto/hwloc

- Configure all PASL binaries to use tcmalloc.

        ./chunkedseq.byte configure -allocator tcmalloc -path_to_tcmalloc /pathto/tcmalloc

- Run all experiments but do not plot.

        ./chunkedseq.byte -skip plot all

- Run just graph experiments and neither plot nor build dependencies.

        ./chunkedseq.byte -skip plot,make dfs
        ./chunkedseq.byte -skip plot,make bfs
        ./chunkedseq.byte -skip plot,make pbfs

- Generate a table reporting on the three experiments from above.

        ./chunkedseq.byte report
